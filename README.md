# 50Projects50Days

I was inspired by [50Projects50Days](https://github.com/bradtraversy/50projects50days/tree/master) and decided to practice with the projects in the same repo to refresh my knowledge and skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The repo contains both basic and advanced level projects, that are sufficient to get oneself confident in these technologies.
